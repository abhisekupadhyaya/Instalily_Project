## Stage 3: Advanced Agentic Graph Implementation

This stage builds upon the enhanced implementation from Stage 2, introduces Agentic Graph Architecture, which manages a network of specialized agent nodes. Each node represents a specific function or capability, and the orchestrator coordinates their interactions to process user queries and generate responses.

### System Overview

The system now consists of five main components:
1. Frontend
2. Backend
3. MongoDB Database
4. Vector Database
5. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System
6. Agentic Graph Architecture

## Frontend

The frontend remain unchanged:

### Key Functions:

- **HTML Capture**: Implement a function to extract the full HTML content of the current webpage.
- **Chat Initialization**: Send the captured HTML to the backend and wait for a "ready" signal before allowing the user to start chatting.
- **Message Handling**: Manage sending user messages and receiving agent responses.

## Backend

The backend now incorporates more advanced processing and retrieval mechanisms:

### Key Components:

- **HTML Parser**: Enhanced parser to extract and structure relevant information from the received HTML.
- **Vector Embeddings Generator**: Convert parsed text into vector embeddings for efficient similarity search.
- **RAG System**: Implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system to enhance response quality.
- **Agentic Workflow**: Refined workflow that leverages RAG and vector search for more accurate and contextual responses.
- **Chat Session Manager**: Handle the creation and tracking of chat sessions using unique chatIDs.

## MongoDB Database

The database structure remains similar, with some additions:

### Data Models:

**Parsed HTML Content**:
```
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  pageUrl: String,
  product: String,
  parsedContent: Object,
  timestamp: Date
}
```

**Chat History**:
```
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  chatID: String,
  messages: [
    {
      role: String,
      content: String,
      timestamp: Date
    }
  ],
  pageUrl: String,
  contextEmbedding: Vector
}
```

## Vector Database

Implement a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Milvus, or Faiss) to store and efficiently retrieve vector embeddings of product information and chat contexts.

### Key Functions:

- **Vector Storage**: Store vector embeddings of parsed HTML content and chat contexts.
- **Similarity Search**: Perform efficient similarity searches to retrieve relevant information.

## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System

Implement a RAG system to enhance the quality and accuracy of the chatbot's responses.

### Key Components:

- **Retriever**: Fetch relevant information from the vector database based on the user's query.
- **Generator**: Use the retrieved information to generate more accurate and contextual responses.


## Agentic Graph Architecture

The core of this implementation is the Agentic Graph Orchestrator, which manages a network of specialized agent nodes. Each node represents a specific function or capability, and the orchestrator coordinates their interactions to process user queries and generate responses.

### Agentic Graph Orchestrator

The orchestrator is responsible for:
- Initializing and managing agent nodes
- Routing information between nodes
- Handling the overall workflow of query processing
- Managing parallel processing of tasks
- Implementing fallback and error-handling mechanisms

### Specialized Agent Nodes

1. **Query Analyzer**
   - Parses user input
   - Determines query intent and type
   - Extracts key entities and parameters

2. **Context Retriever**
   - Interfaces with the vector database
   - Retrieves relevant product information and chat history
   - Performs similarity searches

3. **RAG Processor**
   - Generates initial responses using the RAG system
   - Enhances responses with additional context

4. **Product Specialist**
   - Handles product-specific queries
   - Accesses detailed product information and specifications

5. **Compatibility Checker**
   - Verifies part compatibility with specific models
   - Handles cross-referencing of product and part information

6. **Installation Guide Generator**
   - Creates step-by-step installation instructions
   - Tailors guides to specific parts and models

7. **Troubleshooter**
   - Diagnoses common issues
   - Provides troubleshooting steps

8. **Transaction Handler**
   - Manages product recommendations
   - Assists with purchase-related queries

9. **Response Synthesizer**
   - Combines information from multiple agents
   - Ensures coherence and relevance of the final response

10. **Quality Assurance Agent**
    - Checks response accuracy and completeness
    - Ensures adherence to scope and guidelines

11. **Learning Agent**
    - Analyzes user interactions
    - Identifies areas for improvement
    - Updates the knowledge base

## Agentic Workflow

1. **Query Reception and Analysis**
   - The Query Analyzer receives the user input
   - It determines the query type and extracts key information
   - The analyzer activates relevant specialized agents based on the query type

2. **Context Retrieval and Enrichment**
   - The Context Retriever fetches relevant information from the vector database
   - It activates the Product Specialist for detailed product information
   - The Compatibility Checker is engaged if the query involves part compatibility

3. **Response Generation**
   - The RAG Processor generates an initial response
   - Specialized agents (e.g., Installation Guide Generator, Troubleshooter) contribute additional information
   - The Response Synthesizer combines inputs from all activated agents

4. **Quality Assurance and Optimization**
   - The Quality Assurance Agent reviews the synthesized response
   - It checks for accuracy, relevance, and adherence to guidelines
   - The response is refined if necessary

5. **Learning and Improvement**
   - The Learning Agent analyzes the interaction
   - It identifies areas for improvement in the response generation process
   - The knowledge base is updated based on new insights

6. **Response Delivery**
   - The final, optimized response is sent back to the user via the frontend
